\subsection*{Question 3 - Distributed Cognition for Road Navigation}

The couple on their voyage from start A to destination B is a part of a larger distributed cognition system. The passenger is typically designated as a person reading the map and giving the instructions to the driver. Here, the latter plays the role of \textbf{acting}, while the former is appointed to \textbf{reasoning}. Although each person in this system has their primary role, they also can be seen as performing the \textit{action} and \textit{reasoning} interchangeably. The passenger who reads the map is \textit{acting} on the map by interacting with it (flipping pages, rotating, marking routes, etc.). The driver \textit{reasons} on the car controllers and on the surrounding environment (changing the speed levels, obeying the traffic rules, reading and interpreting to road signs, etc). 

The map itself serves as an external \textbf{memory} of the route, so the passenger who guides the driver does not need to remember the entire direction from start to destination. The entire map can be considered as a \textit{long-term} memory, while the current page (or a fold, depending on the map format) represent the \textit{short-term} memory. The map by itself is meaningless because it requires other agents, such the passenger to interpret it. The markings on the map that highlight some of the routes serve as a \textit{working memory} that helps visualize the chosen roads from the whole map. The markings provide an additional artifact as a cognitive resource to reduce the cognitive load from the interpreter. This exemplifies the benefits of the distributed cognition where maps, markings, the couple are a part of the large cognitive system. 

Looking at the map, the passenger has to orient it in the right direction to interpret the road charts correctly. This specific cognitive function can be offloaded to a compass that serves as a \textbf{perception}. Working out the answer, such as where is north or south, using the compass tool, again extends the individual's working memory. They do not need to keep track for how many times they have turned to correctly orient themselves. Other artifacts, such as road signs, can serve a similar function of helping to perceive the orientation. Additionally, the travellers can stops at the gas stations and ask for directions if the map, compass, and the street signs are insufficient for planning and executing the trip.

From the perspective of a \textbf{social cognition}, the couple may share their \textit{rememberings} and \textit{perceptions} based on the previously held conversations and experiences. The interaction here may turn out to be very complex in a sense that it can take into account the history of the relationships, and their mutual awareness of each others individuality. If the passenger is aware of the driver's nearsightedness that limits the distance from where the driver can read the signs, the passenger acts as a part of a social cognitive system by interpreting some of the signs in advance. Similarly, if the driver is aware that their partner who interpreters the map and gives the directions, tends to confuse the \textit{right} from the \textit{left} (hypothetically), then their collaboration cognition may involve confirming the direction where it mismatches their expectation based on the perception of the general direction of the trip. 

The distributed cognition without the social aspect does not place the emphasis on the individualism of people involved. The collaboration is therefore viewed in the scope of information exchange between the components of the system. The enrichment comes from the social interaction where the knowledge can be shared, and the agent's actions are coordinated with a sense of a common goal. 


\subsection*{Question 4 - Distributed Cognition on the example of Yousician App}

Yousician is an innovate application with elements of game playing that allows students to learn how to play piano, guitar, and other musical instruments\cite{eli2017yousician}. It is a fun educational app that involves following step-by-step tutorials, exercises, and play-alongs. Figure~\ref{fig::2} shows an example of a screen that user interacts with. Our obvious \textbf{task} here is \textit{playing} the provided music sheets.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.35]{figures/p3/yousician.png}
\caption{A screenshot from Yousician App that teachers the user to play piano}
\label{fig::2}
\end{figure}

The shown music score serves as a external \textbf{memory} unit, as the user does not need to remember the structure of all notes. The person interacting with the interface, reads and \textbf{reasons} over the note arrangement to play the matching notes on the piano keyboard. Here, the physical keyboard is being \textbf{acted} upon that produces a sound. Both, the person and the piano keyboard, can be seen as \textit{actors} in this cognitive system. The person presses (acts on) the key which activates a small hammer inside the piano that hits (acts on) a string or strings. 

The device through which the piano and app are connected, listens to the produced pitches and \textbf{perceives} the accuracy of the play. Here again, the human also \textbf{perceives} the sounds, however his/her cognitive load for interpreting the correctness of each note is reduced by distributing the evaluation to the device (iPad, laptop, smartphone). 

Another aspect of \textbf{memory} unit is being able to re-play the entire piece so that the user can \textbf{reason} on the quality of their performance. They may not remember where they made mistakes and how many. They may not even perceive that the some pitches were incorrect. Being able to review the performance after with a visual interface helps them \textit{remember} the mistakes made during the execution. By highlighting the incorrect notes, the interface can be thought as a reasoning artifact. Within the distributed cognitive system, each component is considered to share a cognitive function even if the object is not animated. The key aspect is that \textit{each} component contributes to the cognition of the system via one or several activities. There is strong delineation between roles and activities among the components. We have showed how a one activity can be shared across portions of the system, both human and artifact alike.
