\begin{abstract}
JupyterLab is a web-based interface for Project Jupyter that provides an interactive and reproducible computing platform\footnote{https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab}. In this project, we evaluate the user interaction with Documents and Kernels, specifically with the Notebook plugin that serves an observable list of cells containing code, markdown, or raw data. Based on the evaluation results we suggest and justify interface improvements that can increase Data Scientists' productivity for creating reproducible computational narratives.
\end{abstract}

\subsection*{Heuristic Evaluation}
Notebooks are a form of interactive computing that allow \textit{more powerful connections between topics, theories, data and results} \cite{perkel2018jupyter}. Figure~\ref{fig::1} shows an example of my current JupyterLab workspace, that include a file navigation section, interactive notebook area, additional consoles, and many other things that the platform provides. As a development environment, JupyterLab allows access to terminals, file viewers, notebooks, text editors - all from one place, which I personally find very convenient. With a rapid growth of data science and machine learning, Jupyter Notebooks have become a standard for creating reproducible computational narratives \cite{perkel2018jupyter}.

\subsubsection*{What works well}
Its most attractive feature - interactivity - thrives in both \textbf{gulfs}: \textbf{execution} and \textbf{evaluation}. The execution gulf is easily bridged as the cells provide a clear indication for where text/code should be entered. In the early stage of planning where the user has to choose an appropriate action out of all possible actions, the interface positions the blinking cursor at the beginning of a cell prompting the user to enter a code inside it. This follows the \textit{consistency} principle for designing interfaces where user can easily transfer the learning between different systems.

Compared to other more traditional IDEs (Integrated Development Environment), the Jupyter Lab has also a much narrower gulf of evaluation. \textit{Running} a cell yields immediate feedback that allows user assessing how well their intentions have been met. The output is displayed \textit{asynchronously} as it is generated in the Kernel allowing user to perceive, interpret, and compare the state of the execution with their goal or a sub-goal.

Cells are viewed as physical building blocks, and as such can be re-arranged using a \textbf{direct manipulation} via drag-n-drop operation. User is engaged in the process of completing their task by 1) planning the action, for example, hovering over the cell that needs to be moved; 2) grabbing the cell and dragging it over the area that specifies the new location; 3) releasing the hold when the cell is aligned with the desired destination. For the described task, the interface becomes \textit{invisible} and intuitive largely due to the tight relationships between two gulfs. As the user is working on their task of cell re-arrangement, the system provides a "hint" in form of target line for where the new cell would land before the action is complete. The \textit{feedback} is easy to interpret, and it matches with what the user is expecting to happen. Therefore, the goal can be accomplished more accurately (cell is in the correct position) and more efficiently (speed of execution) without the user focusing on the interface.


\subsubsection*{What doesn't works well}
Drag-n-dropping cells works pretty well when the distance between the positions (current and the desired) is small. As the distance increases, and the user has to scroll through the page while simultaneously "dragging" a cell, the \textbf{ease and comfort} principles are infringed that reduce the overall efficiency in accomplishing the task. 

Current implementation of the interface provides signifiers located in the toolbar for adding and deleting cells (see Figure~\ref{fig::2}). There are two issues with the chosen position for those two opposing operations: 1) by placing them \textit{next to each other}, the interface invites user errors such as \textbf{slips}; 2) by situating them on the toolbar the \textbf{gulf of execution} is widened at the stage of \textit{performing} an action.

The user has a correct \textit{mental model} on how to add or delete a cell as the icons for signifiers are self-explanatory and consistent. However, a user intending to do one action, for example, adding a cell, may inadvertently execute the opposing one - deletion. This is an example of \textit{action-based} slip that occurred due to a rushed user behavior. 

A sub-optimal interaction with executing the action (add/delete) presents itself again when the notebook is long enough that the user needs to move the mouse between the current position and the toolbar. This increases the \textit{gulf of execution} and decreases the efficiency especially for new users who have not learned the shortcuts for these commands.  

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{figures/project-principles/jupyter_add_delete.png}
\caption{Aspect of the interface that allow Slip errors}
\label{fig::2}
\end{figure}

Another feature that contributes to a wide execution gulf is \textit{merging} cells that is a commonly requested action. The aspect of the interface that is designated for this functionality violates the \textbf{discoverability} principle. Unlike other operations, merging is accessible via \textit{Edit} Menu -> Merge Selected Cells and thus not easily discoverable. The contextual menu available at the right-click of the does not include the pointer to the merging operation. The mismatch between menus fails the consistency check \textit{within} the application, and further increases the gulf of execution.

\end{figure}


\subsection*{Interface Redesign}
We redesign the Notebook interface by adding \textbf{six} different components that can improve user's efficiency.

\subsubsection*{1. Expand/Collapse Side Bar}
Figure~\ref{fig::4} (in the area labeled as 1) shows a small arrow in the left side (mid-point) that suggests that an area has been collapsed and it can be expanded. The expansion area is designed to reveal \textbf{new} controllers that are not available in the default view. After the expansion the side bar (see Figure~\ref{fig::5}) displays the additional affordances described below.

\subsubsection*{2. Delete a Cell}
The rightmost edge of the cell is augmented with a \textit{right cross}  that suggest that a cell can be deleted by clicking on the little rectangle area (see Figure~\ref{fig::4} - section labeled as 2)

\subsubsection*{3. Ticker to Add Cells}
Each cell will be decorated with a small tick in a shape of a \textit{triangle} that upon hovering over with a mouse will give a \textit{hint} for the action. By clicking on the triangle, a new cell line is added above (see Figure~\ref{fig::4} - section labeled as 3)

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/project-principles/jupyter_mock_screen_a.png}
\caption{Screen A: Mockup of the Jupyter Notebook Interface}
\label{fig::4}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{4. Force order the cells}
Figure~\ref{fig::5} demonstrates the features that become available after the side bar has been extended. Here we have a depiction of each cell where user can enter a number to force the order of the cells (see section labeled as 4). This feature is inspired by Netflix's movie queue. 

\subsubsection*{5. Move to the top}
Another feature inspired by the Netflix's queue management is an \textit{arrow} and \textit{top} that allow the user to move certain cells to the top of the queue (most applicable to \textit{import} cells). Both features (force order and move to the top) are hidden from the default view to avoid the clutter.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/project-principles/jupyter_mock_screen_b.png}
\caption{Screen B: Mockup of the Jupyter Notebook Interface}
\label{fig::5}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{6. In-context Operations}
The last feature in the redesign is shown in Figure~\ref{fig::6}, and it appear upon \textit{cell-selection} operation. In mock-up screen, when the user highlights a sequence of cells, the interface suggests three possible operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Run} the selected cells depicted by an icon of a running person
    \item \textit{Merge} the selected cells depicted by an icon of arrow connected at a point.
    \item \textit{Copy} the selected cells depicted by an icon of two stacked papers.
\end{itemize}

Although the described operations are represented by visual icons, when the user places their mouse over designated areas, an additional small pop-up area appears with \textit{text} labels for the fucntions - \textit{Run}, \textit{Merge}, \textit{Copy}.

\includegraphics[scale=.6]{figures/project-principles/jupyter_mock_screen_c.png}
\caption{Screen C: Mockup of the Jupyter Notebook Interface}
\label{fig::6}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Interface Justification}
Third, justify the redesigned interface. Describe how your redesigned interface addresses the criticisms from the first section, while preserving the positive elements of the original interface. Again, make sure to put your justification in terms of the principles covered in Unit 2, both conceptually and using the same vocabulary. You need not focus on the same principles covered in the previous section; you may, for example, leverage a particular principle to improve the interface even if it wasn’t explicitly violating that principle in the first place.
